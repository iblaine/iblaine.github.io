description: Building a standbeest bike that's part bike, half legs.
---

Some friends and I built a strandbeest bike that's part bike, part strandbeest.  Here it is on an episode of Tosh.o.

FWIW, I did not get permission to put this video up on youtube but Tosh.o didn’t seek permission to put our video up on their TV show so…we are even.

Here is the bike on display at an exhibit at the Exploratorium in San Francisco for a strandbeest event.

#### Answers to common questions...

Q.  Why not put legs on the front?

A. Putting legs on the front would probably prevent it from turning.  Plus the idea is to make it half bike, half legs.  It needs at least one wheel.

Q. Is it fast?

A. No

Q. Can it climb hills?

A. Probably not.  it needs a level surface with as few curves as possible.
